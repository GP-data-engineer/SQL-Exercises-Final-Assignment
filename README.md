# SQL-Exercises-Final-Assignment
A collection of SQL exercises and solutions covering advanced querying, joins, grouping, aggregation, and views. 

This repository contains a set of **SQL tasks and solutions** prepared as part of postgraduate studies  
(*Artificial Intelligence in Data Analysis*, University of Economics in Katowice, 2024–2025).  

The queries are designed for the **Northwind**-style sample database and demonstrate practical usage of SQL for business data analysis.

## 📌 Content

The file `Grzegorz_Pieniak_Gr_1_SQL_zadania_zaliczenie.sql` includes:

- **Filtering & conditions** – complex `WHERE` clauses, ranges, and string matching
- **Sorting & ordering** – custom sorting by price, stock, or shipment dates
- **Grouping & aggregation** – `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, counts, averages
- **Joins** – `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT/RIGHT JOIN`, and subqueries
- **Date operations** – extracting day, month, year, comparing delivery delays
- **Case expressions** – conditional logic for discounts and order categories
- **Views** – creating and dropping analytical views for customers and orders
- **Business insights** – queries solving realistic scenarios (e.g., order delays, product discounts, customer activity)

## 🚀 Example Tasks

- Products sold in **boxes** with stock between 20 and 35, sorted by price  
- Orders delivered to **France or Germany**, in cities starting with B, K, or P  
- Customers who placed orders in the **first 5 days of each month**  
- Average delivery time by **employee**  
- **Discount rules** depending on product category  
- Customers with **total purchases above 5000** in Germany  
- Orders grouped into **small, medium, and large** based on value  

## 🛠️ Requirements

- SQL Server / T-SQL compatible environment (tested with Microsoft SQL Server)
- Northwind or equivalent demo database

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to practice **SQL for data analysis** in business contexts.  
The queries simulate real reporting tasks that analysts or engineers may encounter when working with sales, logistics, and customer data.
